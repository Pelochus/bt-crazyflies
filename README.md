## Control & Coordination of Crazyflie drones | Bachelor's Thesis
Control and Coordination of Crazyflie drones using Paparazzi UAV project. This is my bachelor's thesis.

The ultimate goal of this work is to achieve coordination among Crazyflies, 
lightweight quadcopters developed by the company Bitcraze, 
through the development of an open-source firmware based on the Paparazzi UAV project 
and the implementation of an algorithm for coordinated movement between them.

These project uses the Crazyflie 2.1 from Bitcraze with its corresponding accessories.
