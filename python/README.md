## Python files for control and coordination
Files for controlling one or more Crazyflie with their official firmware

### crazyflie_demo.py
Take-off, move 0.5m forward, move 0.5 backwards and land.
Needs Flow Deck v2 and Crazyradio.

### crazyflie_swarm_demo.py
Take-off and land, with some LEDs flashing.
Needs Crazyradio and changing the URIs of the involved Crazyflies so they are not the same one.

### crazyflie_single_segment.py
Based off the `crazyflie_demo.py`, it is pretty much the same but follows a segment indefinitely.
Try it out before going into `crazyflie_segment_formation.py` to make sure it follows segment decently.
It also shows the estimated position. 

### crazyflie_segment_formation.py
Uses 2 Crazyflies in parallel running in parallel segments with GVF.
Then, an algorithm coordinates them so that the move next to each other in their corresponding segment.

### sim and lighthouse folders
The first one contains a graphical experiment made for my thesis,
with one log from a real drone and a simulated drone using the algorithm developed for this thesis.

The lighthouse folder has modified files from this folder adapted for the Lighthouse Positioning System.
It ended up in failures, so I advise against using it as is.
