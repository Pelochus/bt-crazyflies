## Python files for control and coordination
Files for controlling one or more Crazyflie with their official firmware

### crazyflie_demo.py
Take-off, move 0.5m forward, move 0.5 backwards and land.
Needs Flow Deck v2 and Crazyradio.

### crazyflie_swarm_demo.py
Take-off and land, with some LEDs flashing.
Needs Crazyradio and changing the URIs of the involved Crazyflies so they are not the same one.

### crazyflie_segment_formation.py
Uses 2 Crazyflies in parallel running in parallel segments with GVF.
Then, an algorithm coordinates them so that the move next to each other in their corresponding segment.
