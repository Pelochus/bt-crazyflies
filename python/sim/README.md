## Simulation
This is a simulation of a second drone for a log from a real segment done by one drone.
To run:

`python experiment.py`

By default it will use the `log.txt` file in this repo.
This log consists of a column of positions logged from a flight from a real drone.

Since this script is not meant to be used further than the experiment I've made for my thesis,
I'm not providing more documentation of how to use it.
